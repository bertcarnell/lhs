	simulations such as arise in particle transport, finance, and queueing.
	LSS is developed as a combination of two widely used methods: Latin
	hypercube sampling (LHS) and quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC). In LSS, the
	input variables are grouped into subsets, and a lower-dimensional
	QMC method is used within each subset. The QMC points are presented
	in random order within subsets. QMC methods have been observed to
	lose effectiveness in high-dimensional problems. This article shows
	that LSS can extend the benefits of QMC to much higher dimensions,
	when one can make a good grouping of input variables. Some suggestions
	for grouping variables are given for the motivating examples. Even
	a poor grouping can still be expected to do as well as LHS. The article
	also extends LHS and LSS to infinite-dimensional problems. The paper
	includes a survey of QMC methods, randomized versions of them (RQMC),
	and previous methods for extending QMC to higher dimensions. Furthermore
	it shows that LSS applied with RQMC is more reliable than LSS with
	QMC.},

	the optimal Latin hypercube
	
	(OLH) sampling provides an extremely efficient technique for assessing
	the values of correlation
	
	coefficients. Since finding the large OLH designs is not a trivial
