         * <blockquote>
         * The addelkemp program produces <code>OA( 2q^2, k, q, 2 ),  k <= 2q+1</code>,
         * for odd prime powers <code>q</code>.  Even prime powers may be produced using
         * bosebush above.  This construction is based on:
         * 
         * <b>S. Addelman and O. Kempthorne (1961) Annals of Mathematical Statistics,
         * Vol 32 pp 1167-1176.</b>
         * 
         * using <code>n=2</code> in their notation.
         * 
         * <code>2q</code> columns can be
         * constructed without a coincidence defect.  Setting <code>k=2q+1</code>
         * leads to an array with the coincidence defect.  Some
         * triples of columns contain duplicate rows.  (The lack of
         * a coincidence defect has been verified for 
         * <code>q = 2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,17,19,23,25</code> and <code>k = 2q</code>.)
         * 
         * This construction should work for all prime powers
         * <code>q</code>, but it failed to do so for even powers greater
         * than 4.  This may have been a programming error, or
         * it may have stemmed from misunderstanding of the description
         * of the algorithm.  The program rejects requests with
         * <code>q = 2^r</code> for <code>r > 2</code>.  The Bose Bush construction handles these
         * cases.
         * 
         * The description of the construction for odd prime powers
         * calls for some arithmetic involving the number 4.  In
         * Galois fields with <code>3^r</code> elements, there is no 4.  Replacing 4
         * by 1 for these fields works when <code>q = 3,9,27</code> (brute force

         * using <code>n=3</code> in their notation.
         *
         * Coincidences are much harder to understand with these designs.
         * For example <code>addelkemp3 3 9</code> does lead to a number of triple
         * coincidences, that is pairs of rows in which 3 columns agree,
         * but no quadruple coincidences.  <code>addelkemp3 9 28</code> produces
         * an extra column that figures in some quadruple coincidences.
         *

         * do not have an element 4.  Also powers of 2 larger than 4
         * are not allowed, as described above for addelkemp.
         * 
         * The article is quite vague on this.  Page 1173 states
         * "When n>2 the same procedure will yield the desired plans
         * if Lemma 5a is used in place of Lemma 5."  Page 1175
         * provides the example n=3,q=3 which is OA( 54,25,3,2 ).
         * Based on this example it is possible to make an educated
         * guess as to how the construction generalizes to n=3.
         * The resulting OA's are seen, by brute force to be of
         * strength 2 for q=2,3,4,5,7,11.  These OAs are:
         * - OA(   16,  13,  2, 2 )   
         * - OA(   54,  25,  3, 2 )

         * - OA(  686, 113,  7, 2 )
         * - OA( 1458, 181,  9, 2 )
         * - OA( 2662, 265, 11, 2 )
         * 
         * The one with q=7 required 212709392 comparisons to determine
         * that it really is of strength 2.  This took roughly 11.5 minutes
         * on a DEC 5000/240 workstation (real and elapsed in this case).
         * The array with q=11 took 1.12671e+10 comparisons to verify its strength.
         * This took roughly 10 1/2 hours.  
         * 
         * For even q, only q= 2 or 4 are available.  The prescription
         * given in Addelman and Kempthorne (1961) does not appear to work.

         * In addition to the strength <code>t</code> described above under
         * the heading orthogonal arrays, strength 0 is taken to 
         * mean that the array indeed has all its elements in the
         * range 0..q-1.
         * 
         * An array of strength <code>t > 0</code> is also of strength <code>s</code> for
         * all <code>0 <= s < t</code>.  The program starts testing <code>t = 0</code> and
         * increases <ocde>t</code> until it finds <code>t</code> for which the array is
         * not strength <code>t</code>.
         * 
         * Finding the strength of an array by brute force is
         * lightning fast for small arrays but very slow for larger
         * arrays.  When the job is large enough, intermediate
         * results are printed so the user can decide whether or
         * not to kill the job, based on how much progress is
         * being made.
         * 
         * The function that calculates strength has an argument
         * verbose.  In oastr the array strength function is
         * called with verbose=2.  This prints to standard output
         * a description of progress as the strength check proceeds.
         * If one wants to use this function in other settings,
         * calling it with verbose=1 shuts off standard output
         * but leaves the warnings to standard error, and verbose=0
         * shuts off all output.
         * 
         * @param verbose should diagnostic message be printed?
         * @return the strength of the array
