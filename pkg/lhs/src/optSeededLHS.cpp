/*
 * Arrays are passed into this routine to allow R to allocate and deallocate
 * memory within the wrapper function.
 * This code uses ISO C90 comment styles and layout
 *
 * "oldHypercube", "newHypercube", and "matrix" are matricies but are treated as one
 * dimensional arrays to facilitate passing them from R.
 * Dimensions:  oldHypercube    N x K
 *              optimalityRecordLength = N choose 2 + 1
 * Parameters:
 *              N:         The number of points to be sampled
 *              K:         The number of dimensions (or variables) needed
 *              maxSweeps: The maximum number of times the exchange algorithm
 *                         is applied across the columns.  Therefor if
 *                         MAXSWEEPS =5 and K = 6 then 30 exchange operations
 *                         could be used.
 *              eps:       The minimum fraction gained in optimality that is
 *                         desired to continue the iterations as a fraction of
 *                         the gain from the first interchange
