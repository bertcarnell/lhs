# Function: improvedLHS.R
# Purpose:  To implement the Improved distributed Hypercube Sampling Algorithm
# Author:   This program is based on the MATLAB program written by
#             John Burkardt and modified 16 Feb 2005
#             http://www.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/m_src/ihs/
#             ihs.m
# R and C code Author:  Rob Carnell
# Created:  May 05
#
# Required C function:  improvedLHS_R.c
#
# Discussion:
#    N Points in an K dimensional Latin hypercube are to be selected.
#    This algorithm tries to pick a solution which has the property that the
#    points are "spread out" as evenly as possible.
#    It does this by determining an optimal even spacing given by OPT
#    It uses the DUPLICATION factor to limit the number of points available
#    to choose from at each step.
#
#  Reference:
#    Brian Beachkofski, Ramana Grandhi,
#    Improved Distributed Hypercube Sampling,
#    American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Paper 2002-1274.
#
#  Parameters:
#    k= positive integer, the spatial dimension.
#    n= positive integer, the number of points to be generated.
#    dup= positive integer, the DUPLICATION factor.
#      (default=1, a value of 5 is reasonable according to Burkardt
#
#  Returns:
#    A Latin Hypercube sample with N rows and K columns where each entry
#    is on the interval [0,1]
#
#  Steps
#   1.  Calculate the optimum spacing interval
#   2.  Select a random starting point and place it in the matrix X
#   3.  Populate the matrix AVAIL with the integers from 1 to N
#   4.  Replace the values in AVAIL which have already been used by the
#       the first point in X with the value N
#   5.  Generate the valid points for each row in a random manner by using
#       the numbers in the rows of AVAIL
#   6.  For each cadidate point, calculate the distance to the points already
#       used in X.  Select the candidate point with the distance value
#       closest to the value of OPT and place it in X
#   7.  Having chosen the new point for X, update AVAIL to replace those
#       numbers in each row that have been used.  The first few columns in
#       AVAIL are valid points.
#   8.  There is only one choice for the last point
