\details{
Augments an existing Latin Hypercube Sample, adding points to the design, while
maintaining the \dquote{latin} properties of the design.  Augmentation is perfomed
in a random manner.

First, create a new matrix to hold the candidate points after the design has
been re-partitioned into \eqn{(n+m)^{2}}{(n+m)^2} cells, where n is number of
points in the original \code{lhs} matrix.  Then randomly sweep through each
column (1\ldots\code{K}) in the repartitioned design to find the missing cells.
For each column (variable), randomly search for an empty row, generate a
random value that fits in that row, record the value in the new matrix.
The new matrix can contain more filled cells than \code{m} unles \eqn{m = 2n},
in which case the new matrix will contain exactly \code{m} filled cells.
Finally, keep only the first m rows of the new matrix, since it is guaranteed to
have \code{m} full rows in the new matrix.  The deleted rows are partially full.
The candidate points are already selected randomly due to the random search
for empty cells.
